# Docket
A ToDo List App in Swift that uses Core data for presistent data storage

This program contains onboarding screens to give an impression of a real application. Then it prompts the user to enter their name and customizes the main screen to the user's typed name. The user can perform basic operations such as adding an item (including the priority of the task -- low, high, or medium), deleting an item, and updating an item. The application uses Core Data to store the user's tasks, so even though the user closes the app, the data can still be retrieved.
